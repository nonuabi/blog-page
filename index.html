        <p>
          I recently completed reading a very inspiring book — IKIGAI — The
          Japanese Secret to a Long Happy Life. The book is authored by Hector
          Garcia and Francesc Miralles. In this article, I am going to talk
          about my learning from the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book touches the various aspects of life which can help us achieve
          a long happy life. It is based on ancient, well practised Japanese
          technique called — IKIGAI.
        </p>

        <p>If you google the word, you will get various meanings like</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >A reason for being, encompassing joy, a sense of purpose and
            meaning and a feeling of well-being</i
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          or
          <br />
          <br />
          <i
            >The word derives from iki, meaning life and kai, meaning the
            realisation of hopes and expectations.</i
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          But the one I liked the most is —
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>A reason to jump out of bed each morning!</i>
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          This book draws a lot of references from an island in Japan called —
          <i>Okinawa</i> where there 24.5 inhabitants of age more 100 for every
          1,00,000 people.
        </p>

        <h3>Blue Zones</h3>
        <p>
          Once you understand the meaning of the word Ikigai, the book tries to
          explain the deep art of staying young while growing old. It gives the
          references of 5 Blue Zones in the world where residents of these
          places live longer than average and secrets of their long life.
        </p>
        <h3>Five blue zones are as follows:</h3>
        <div class="five-zones">
          <div id="sardinia-zone" class="images1">
            <img
              src="assets/images/five island/1jpg.jpg"
              alt="sardinia island picture"
            />
            <h4>The Italian island of Sardinia.</h4>
          </div>
          <div id="okinawa-zone" class="images1">
            <img src="assets/images/3.jpg" />
            <h4>Okinawa, Japan.</h4>
          </div>
          <div id="loma-zone" class="images2">
            <img src="assets/images/five island/3.jpg" />
            <h4>Loma Linda, California.</h4>
          </div>
          <div id="nicoya-zone" class="images2">
            <img
              src="assets/images/five island/4.jpg"
              alt="nicoya island picture"
            />
            <h4>Costa Rica's isolated Nicoya Peninsula.</h4>
          </div>
          <div id="ikaria-zone" class="images3">
            <img
              src="assets/images/five island/5.jpg"
              alt="ikaria island picture"
            />
            <h4>Ikaria, an isolated Greek island.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Little Stress is good for you</h3>
        <img
          src="assets/images/stress.jpg"
          alt="stressed looking person picture"
        />
        <p>
          In next chapter, book explains how stress, a lot sitting adds up to
          your age and makes reduces your life duration. Interesting it also
          mentions very prominently that little stress is good for you since it
          keeps you going. I firmly believe — Being Conscious of Your Daily
          Routine Can Lead to A Better Life!
        </p>
        <h3>Discover the meaning of your life</h3>
        <p>
          In the subsequent chapter, it helps you deep dive into discovering the
          meaning of your life. It is quite evident that the authors stress more
          on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you!
        </p>
        <h3>Finding flow in everything that you do</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/flow.jpeg" alt="mountains picture" />
        <p>
          This part is my most favourite where the authors helps you find the
          meaning of being in the flow. If you have discovered the meaning of
          your life, you need to completely immerse into the experience without
          being distracted by the surroundings and you attain the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book also talks about some very interesting techniques to practice
          which can help you achieve the flow.
        </p>
        <h3>Practising the techniques</h3>
        <img
          src="assets/images/mindfullness.jpeg"
          alt="a sticker on which mindfulness is written"
        />
        <p>
          The last section talks about collection of various different
          techniques which help you keep your mind and body intact. It talks
          about —
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meditation</li>
          <li>Yoga</li>
          <li>Surya Namaskara</li>
          <li>Radio Taiso</li>
          <li>Tai Chi</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wabi Sabi</h3>
        <p>
          The book concludes after introducing to another Japanese Technique
          called — Wabi-Sabi. This techniques talks about finding beauty in
          imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is preferred over
          perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and
          ephemeral things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          To conclude, I think the book is extremely inspiring and full of
          content. I could attain my flow while reading it. Loved it ! Highly
          recommended reading —
